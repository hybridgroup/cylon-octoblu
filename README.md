# Cylon.js For Skynet

Cylon.js (http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using Node.js

This repository contains the Cylon adaptor for the Skynet ([http://skynet.im](http://skynet.im)) machine to machine instant messaging open source software.

## How to Install

Install the module with:

    $ npm install cylon cylon-skynet

## How to Use

```javascript
var Cylon = require("cylon");

Cylon.robot({
  connections: {
    arduino: { adaptor: "firmata", port: "/dev/tty.usbmodem1411" },
    skynet: { adaptor: "skynet", uuid: "SKYNET_UUID", token: "SKYNET_TOKEN" }
  },

  devices: {
    led: { driver: "led", pin: 13, connection: "arduino" }
  },

  work: function(my) {
    my.skynet.on("message", function(data) {
      console.log(data);

      if (data.payload.red === "on") {
        my.led.turnOn();
      } else if (data.payload.red === "off") {
        my.led.turnOff();
      }
    });
  }
}).start();
```

## How to Connect

First, you need to register a device on the Skynet network. You can do this with a curl command similar to this one:

    $ curl -X POST http://meshblu.octoblu.com/devices

This will return the new registration information for the device, most importantly the `uuid` and `token`:

```json
{"geo":{"range":[1344446976,1344447487],"country":"ES","region":"56","city":"Cornellá De Llobregat","ll":[41.35,2.0833],"metro":0},"ipAddress":"80.34.162.160","online":false,"timestamp":"2015-03-05T14:35:23.638Z","uuid":"db895340-c344-11e4-9f09-df7578d68eac","token":"d0a9f0d7e321657a38d25dd492492ffed0baf773"}
```
